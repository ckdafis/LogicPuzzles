    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is a single-page app (SPA) featuring a main "Puzzle Library" view. Puzzles are presented as interactive cards, categorized into "Classic" and "Advanced" sections. Clicking a card opens a full-screen modal overlay, which serves as the dedicated workspace for solving that puzzle. This modal contains the puzzle's story, clues, an interactive answer area, and options to check the answer or view the solution. This structure was chosen for its excellent usability, as it focuses user attention on one task at a time while keeping the main library easily accessible without page reloads, providing a seamless and intuitive user flow. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Puzzles are represented by "cards" (styled divs) for a clean, selectable interface. User input is handled by dynamically generated form elements within the modal: radio buttons for single-choice answers, dropdowns for matching or multi-part answers, and text inputs for specific string answers. This ensures the interaction method is always appropriate for the question type. Feedback is provided via a color-changing div for immediate confirmation, and solutions are hidden by default to encourage attempts. All interactions are powered by vanilla JavaScript, and styling is exclusively handled by Tailwind CSS. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

But he is a doctor, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, A must be a patient (liar). Since A is a patient, his statement must be a lie. The lie is "We are both patients." The logical opposite of this is "At least one of us is not a patient (is a doctor)." Since we already know A is a patient, for the statement to be a lie, B must be a doctor.'

This would make the Silver inscription ("The portrait is not in this casket") true as well. This violates the rule of "at most one is true". So the Gold inscription must be false. Since the Gold inscription is false, this means the portrait is NOT in the Gold casket. This makes the Lead inscription ("The portrait is not in the Gold casket") TRUE. Since we can have at most one true statement, the Lead inscription must be the only true one. This means the Silver inscription must be false.

This would make C the Knave. If C is the Knave, then A\'s statement ("C is the Knave") is TRUE. This makes A the Knight. If A is the Knight, then B\'s statement ("A is the Knight") is also TRUE.

If he saw a white hat on the front prisoner, he would know his own must be red (to avoid the two-white-hats scenario).

If B answers \'ja\', then either B is Random, or C is the non-random one you are looking for. If B answers \'da\', then either B is Random, or A is the non-random one.

                    solution: 'Let\'s analyze A\'s statement. If A were a Knight, his statement would be true. But the first part, "I am a Knave," would be false. A true statement cannot have a false part in a conjunction. So, A cannot be a Knight. Therefore, A must be a Knave, and his entire statement is a lie. The statement is a conjunction: (A is a Knave) AND (B is not a Knave). For this "P and Q" statement to be false, at least one part must be false. We know the first part, "A is a Knave," is actually true. So, the second part, "B isn\'t a Knave," must be the false part. If "B isn\'t a Knave" is false, then B IS a Knave. Therefore, both A and B are Knaves.'

                    solution: 'Let\'s analyze Cellini\'s statement. Case 1: Cellini is telling the truth. If his statement is true, then exactly one of the two statements is true. Since his own statement is the true one, Bellini\'s must be false. If Bellini\'s statement ("Portrait not in Gold") is false, then the portrait IS in the Gold casket. Case 2: Cellini is lying. If his statement is false, then it is NOT the case that "exactly one" statement is true. This means either both are true or both are false. But the puzzle states at least one is lying, so they can\'t both be true. Therefore, both must be false. If Bellini\'s statement ("Portrait not in Gold") is false, then the portrait IS in the Gold casket. Both scenarios lead to the same conclusion.'

You then weigh three balls from G3 against three known good balls. If they do not balance, you know the odd ball is in the eight you weighed, and you know if it\'s on the heavy or light side.

                    solution: '1. Albert knows the month. For him to know that Bernard *also* doesn\'t know, Albert\'s month cannot contain a unique day. The unique days are 18 and 19. This eliminates May and June. The month must be July or August. 2. Bernard hears this. He now knows the month is July or August. He says he now knows the date. This means his day is not the number 14 (which appears in both July and August). So the date must be July 16, Aug 15, or Aug 17. 3. Albert hears this. He now knows the birthday. If the month he was told was August, there would still be two possibilities (Aug 15, Aug 17), so he couldn\'t know. Therefore, the month he was told must be July, which only has one remaining possibility. The birthday is July 16.'
